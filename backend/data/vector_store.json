World military spending grew for the eighth\nconsecutive year in 2022, up 3.7 per cent to an all-time high of\n$2240 billion. The increase in world spending in 2022 was largely due to\nthree factors: Russia’s invasion of Ukraine; the increase in military spend­\ning by Central and Western Europe countries as a reaction to the invasion\nand expenditure rises in major powers in Asia, namely China, India and\nJapan. There were two major military expenditure related developments\nin 2022 linked to the war in Ukraine. Firstly, Central and Western European\nresponded to the deteriorating security situation by announcing plans to\nsubstantially increases their military spending.

By removing the effects of inflation and expressing the financial cost of military\nactivities in a common currency, military expenditure given in constant US dollar is ideal for analysis\naimed at either across country, over time or both. Military spending as a share of GDP, also known as\nmilitary burden, represents the economic cost associated with the military relative to the economy.\nIn other words, it shows how much of available total output is devoted to military activities. The\nmeasure, being a share, is comparable across country and over time without the complications of\nchoosing a price deflator or base year exchange rate. This measure is also ideal for cross-country or\nover time analysis, but it does carry the drawback of not offering any information about the level of\nmilitary expenditure.\nIrrespective of which measure of military spending users choose, there needs to be careful\nconsideration of the data, such as the shap","source":"C:\\Users\\kshit\\Documents\\GitHub\\meow\\backend\\uploads\\Developments in Military Expenditure and the Effects of the War in Ukraine.txt"},{"text":"offering any information about the level of\nmilitary expenditure.\nIrrespective of which measure of military spending users choose, there needs to be careful\nconsideration of the data, such as the shape or distribution over time and across countries.
