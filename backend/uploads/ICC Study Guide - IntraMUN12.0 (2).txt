game. Thus, it falls to ICC to ensure that all
stakeholders have their needs respected for a
mutually beneficial outcome of promoting
cricket.2

COMMITTEE OVERVIEW
The International Cricket Council (ICC) acts as the
global governing body of cricket. It has 108
members, each being the cricket board
representing nations or a collection of nations.
Though the ICC does not have an explicit
mandate, it is focused on the promotion of cricket
and works in all spheres related to it. This
includes
reviewing
playing
conditions,
appointing match officials for international
games and organising ICC tournaments.

AGENDA OVERVIEW
This agenda is centred around ensuring the longterm safety and growth of Test cricket.
Considered to be the purest and oldest format of
the sport, test cricket has been played since the
inception of cricket. However, with the rise of
T20s, and consequently T20 Franchise leagues, it
has struggled to stay relevant, as audiences
prefer flashy, fast-paced action over the test of
endurance that is Test cricket.

Another important aspect of the ICC is the
preservation of the well-known “Spirit of Cricket”
along with ensuring the obeyance of the ICC Code
of Conduct. Thus, the ICC has several cells
dedicated to ensuring fair play, such as the AntiCorruption Unit to combat Match Fixing, and the
Anti-Doping Program which is compliant with
WADA’s
(World
Anti-Doping
Agency)
regulations to prevent doping in international
games.1

In this session, the committee will formulate
strategies and ideas that are focused on the
preservation of the legacy of Test cricket and
balancing the interests of all stakeholders.

STRUCTURE FOR THE CONFERENCE
As the administrative body, the ICC has a Board of
Directors, which consists of the ICC Chair, and
representatives from each of the 12 Full Members
and 3 Associate Member Representatives. For this
conference, we will be convening a joint session
of the ICC which alongside this, will also include
representatives from the other ICC committees—
the Strategic Growth Committee, Finance and
Commercial Affairs Committee, and the Chairs of
the Men’s and Women’s Cricket Committees.

For such units, the ICC tends to focus on enforcing
the minimum requirements in international
games, and provides resources to all members to
apply them domestically at their own discretion.
For example, their Anti-Corruption Unit Network
consists of domestic anti-corruption units which
have modelled their codes after the ACU’s code.
“Cricket is unique in that there are obligations within
its Laws that require the captains, players and match
officials to uphold the ‘spirit of the sport’.”

For another perspective, there will also be a
representative for the Federation of International
Cricketers’ Association (FICA), the Marylebone
Cricket Club (MCC), former and current men’s and

At its core, the ICC focuses on the development of
cricket from the grassroots to the pinnacle of the

BACKGROUND

There will be several external stakeholders
invited for the session, including major
broadcasting partners, eminent personalities in
the sport and three of the foremost T20 franchise
leagues in the world.

Historical Significance
The ICC was originally suggested as the ‘Imperial
Cricket Board’, the brainchild of Abe Bailey,
President of the South African Cricket Association
at the time. He proposed a triangular test series
between the three test-playing nations at the
time, England, Australia, and South Africa, in
1909. Eventually, the body known as the ‘Imperial
Cricket Conference’—the precursor to the ICC—
was constituted on 15th June 1909. Through its
meetings, the proposal for the triangular series
was accepted, though it eventually occurred in
1912.4

However, the league and broadcaster
representatives, the Chairs of the Men’s and
Women’s Cricket Committees, and eminent
experts will not have substantive voting rights for
this session.

INTRODUCTION
Test cricket is widely known as the pinnacle of
skill in cricket, yet the oldest format of the game
has faced perhaps its toughest years in the last
decade. With the advent of the T20 era, highly
lucrative, franchise-based T20 leagues are
organised all over the world, drawing eyeballs in
far greater numbers than Tests, and thus forcing
Test cricket to fight for its relevance.

In the summer of 1926, the conference met again
and changed the definition of its membership,
thus granting admission to the West Indies, New
Zealand, and India as test-playing nations.
From this point onward, the Conference began to
move towards a more governing role, planning
tours, checking the qualifications of players, and
discussing matters of the rules of the sport.

While test cricket is still universally recognised as
the purest format of the game, it faces severe
headwinds, with both players and test-playing
nations opting to save their best players for T20
leagues, where both players and Cricket Boards
are well compensated compared to the meagre
financial rewards of tests, especially outside of
the Big 3 nations.3

At this point, test matches were played as tours
between the test-playing nations, and
membership remained constant for several
years, until 1952, when the admission of Pakistan
added another test-playing nation.
Evolution

Discussions on revitalising Test Cricket will
consider four major challenges–declining
viewership, financial viability, scheduling and
workload Management, and a lack of

In 1961, South Africa officially withdrew from the
Commonwealth, making them ineligible for
membership. Thus, South Africa ceased to be a
member of the Conference.

The Conference’s evolution into the body we
know today was accelerated in 1964, when for the
first time, ‘Associate Membership’ was adopted,
allowing the USA, Ceylon and Fiji to join. The next
July, the ICC changed its name to the
International Cricket Conference, reflecting its
new global nature. Several more associates
joined in the following years.5

interest. However, Test cricket encountered a
major setback with the introduction of T20s,
which were initially dismissed by purists and
cricketers alike.
Yet, with fans supporting T20s, Test cricket soon
found itself relegated to being thought of as the
slow, boring format in common consciousness.
By 2019, the ICC acted upon the issue to prevent
Test Cricket from dying out, creating the World
Test Championship.

In 1971, the ICC began planning its first ODI World
Cup, featuring 60 overs per side.

Introduction of the World Test Championship.

In 1976, Kerry Packer, an Australian broadcasting
magnate and owner of Channel Nine took an
unprecedented step in the history of cricket. He
was furious with the Australian Cricket Board for
their decision to award the broadcasting rights
for the Australian cricket season to the state
broadcaster, a long-term partner. Thus, he went
about signing over three dozen of the world’s
best players to create his own tournament: World
Series Cricket.6

The introduction of the World Test
Championship (WTC) was a way to enhance the
relevance of the bilateral series played by Full
Member nations amongst each other. Though a
ranking system existed, it was merely a rolling
table and all but symbolic. However, with this
format, the top two nations at the end of the twoyear cycle would play a final, with the winner
being awarded the title of World Test
Champions, a test equivalent to the ODI and T20
World Cup.

Similar to the T20s of today, this tournament had
posed a credible threat of replacing Test cricket as
the dominant format. However, World Series
Cricket left lasting consequences. Players were
finally paid appropriately to be full-time
professionals and day-night matches gained
popularity.

Originally, each series was allocated 120 points,
distributed based on the number of matches,
with all 9 participating teams out of the 12 Full
Members playing an equal number of series.
Thus, in a 3-match series, winning 1 match was
worth 40 points; while in a 5-match series, it was
worth only 24 points. A draw was worth a third of
the points for winning, thus incentivising
aggressive play to reduce draws. This highlighted

In 1990, the ICC adopted its current name, and
gained stature as a governing body with the
ability to force members to comply with its
directives.7
In the years that followed, Test cricket continued
to be played, though it had to share the spotlight
with ODIs. However, its status as the pure form of
the game was still intact, and thus still had

based tournaments like: the Indian Premier
League (IPL), SA20 (South Africa's premier T20
cricket league), and the Big Bash League (a
professional Twenty20 cricket league in
Australia)
attract
massive
audiences.
Consequently, sponsorship deals, media rights,
and player salaries are all higher. Moreover,
shorter matches are more suitable for
broadcasters, as they fit more easily into
schedules and programming slots, offering
greater flexibility.

However, in the second WTC cycle, from 2021 to
2023, this format was changed to a win
percentage system which is followed presently as
well. In this system, each match is worth 12
points, regardless of the number of games in a
series. It was introduced to ensure that the
cancellation of games due to any reason does not
result in a direct impact on the standings.
The WTC was successful in its goal of giving
meaning to bilateral test series and providing
teams with an incentive to compete in test
matches by means of another ICC trophy.
However, several gaps remain, highlighting the
need for further improvements in the system.
One of the major criticisms of the WTC is that,
with two teams advancing to the finals, a great
deal of matches at the lower ends of the table are
dead rubber, as neither side have a chance at
qualification. Related to this is the issue that
although Test series among the Big 3, i.e. the
Ashes, the Border-Gavaskar Trophy and the
Pataudi/Anthony De Mello trophy, have gained
prominence and viewership beyond the
dedicated fanbase, the other countries have
struggled to find similar interest and
engagement for their matches.

Furthermore, franchise leagues offer lucrative
careers for cricketers, tilting their interests away
from Test cricket. Former Indian cricketer Dinesh
Karthik specifically emphasized this financial
disparity and insisted on cricket boards to ensure
that Test players are compensated well. He
stated that people who choose Test cricket
should be financially wealthy and have sufficient
opportunities to compete, as T20 is already
thriving in that regard. This highlights the
growing trend whereby players opt for the
shorter formats because of the financial security
they offer.
Additionally, the hosting and organization of
franchise cricket demand relatively lower
operational costs, making it another factor
diminishing the financial appeal of Test cricket.
Ian Chappell, former Australian Captain, said in
an interview that non-traditional cricketing
countries prefer T20s due to the ‘prohibitive cost
of developing Test venues and players. For
several
upcoming
cricketing
nations,
maintaining a domestic Test structure is

Thus, nearing the end of the third WTC cycle, Test
Cricket requires a significant boost to sustain its
relevance and compete with the rapidly growing
dominance of T20s in the cricketing world.

economically unfeasible.9 Even established
cricketing nations struggle to sustain Test cricket,
considering the low returns that traditional fiveday Test matches yield compared to T20 leagues,
which are high-return ventures.

Members who fear that reduced funding could
eventually make the game unsustainable in their
respective countries.12 They also believe that such
a model could limit financial support for
infrastructure development and player retention
in Test cricket. 13

Financial Disparities and Revenue Constraints

Former South African captain Graeme Smith has
also expressed the need for a more balanced
revenue-sharing model to keep Test cricket alive.
He pointed out that while scheduling is often the
main topic of discussion, the real challenge lies in
financial modelling.14 Smith has strongly
advocated for a revenue-sharing model that
would incentivize countries to allocate more
resources to Test cricket rather than prioritizing
wealthier T20 leagues.15

The revenue distribution model of the ICC for the
period 2024-27 is deemed unfair by many Full
and Associate members. According to this model,
the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) has
been given a substantial 38.5% of the ICC's annual
returns, amounting to approximately USD 230
million per year, due to its significant
contribution to the commercial revenue
generated from the sport. 10Additionally, other
Full Member nations such as South Africa and the
West Indies are allocated smaller shares, with
South Africa receiving an estimated USD 26.24
million, and West Indies around USD 27.50
million annually. Collectively, Full Members are
projected to receive 88.81% of the USD 600
million annual pool, leaving Associate Members
with 11.19%. 11
This imbalance of revenue sharing is worrisome
for Associate members and less affluent Full

Furthermore, Test cricket has evolved into a
landscape where the Next Six secure victories in
away games against each other but struggle on
the home grounds of the Big Three. Meanwhile,
the Big Three dominate Tests in the Next Six
nations, facing major challenges only from fellow
Big Three teams on home soil.

‘Big Three’ Dominance

This widening gap is likely to make Test cricket
the exclusive domain of the Big Three, which
would be detrimental to the growth of cricket in
emerging nations and the overall popularity of
the format.

The dominance of the ‘Big Three’—India,
England, and Australia—has created a divide in
Test cricket. These countries play a greater
number of Test matches, generate higher profits
due to better audience engagement, and have a
better winning percentage at home compared to
other nations with Test-playing status, which
face financial and infrastructural constraints.
Over the past 15 years, England, Australia, and
India have played approximately 12 Test matches
per year—around 50% more than the Next Six
Test-playing nations. While the number of
matches for the Next Six has not drastically
declined, the imbalance in fixtures continues to

Uncertainty Over the Efficacy of Recent
Discussions on the Dedicated Fund
The ICC is exploring the introduction of a
dedicated fund aimed at supporting nations
outside the Big Three to strengthen their Test
cricket programs. This initiative, led by Cricket
Australia chair Mike Baird and backed by the
Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and
the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), seeks

Test cricket’s sustainability outside its most
profitable markets.

The goal is to provide financial assistance to
smaller cricketing nations, allowing them to offer
a minimum match fee of USD 10,000 to players.
This is intended to make Test cricket a more
viable career option amid the financial allure of
franchise leagues, while also easing the financial
burden on smaller boards that struggle to afford
hosting and touring costs.

and

Viewership Concerns
The decline of Test cricket is not just a sporting
issue but also a reflection of broader societal
changes. As attention spans shorten, the slow,
strategic nature of Test cricket struggles to
compete with the fast-paced excitement of T20
leagues. The rise of digital entertainment and the
demand for shorter, easily consumable content
have limited Test cricket’s appeal primarily to
traditionalists. Countries outside the Big Three
have particularly suffered, with sparsely
populated stadiums. 19

However, opinions on the efficacy of this
dedicated fund are divided. Proponents argue
that this would acknowledge the disparities in
Test cricket funding and provide struggling
boards with much-needed resources. It could
prevent the decline of Tests by incentivising
players to participate in Tests rather than shorter
formats of the sport. In contrast, sceptics argue
that the fund is unlikely to bring meaningful
change. Ex-CEO of Cricket West Indies (CWI)
Johnny Grave says that a USD 10,000 match fee
will not make a difference for teams like the West
Indies, where players already receive similar
payments.18 Instead, he emphasizes the need for
deeper structural reforms, such as scheduling
more three-match series, creating dedicated Test
windows, and strengthening 'A' team programs.
While the fund represents a shift in mindset from
the Big Three, critics believe that financial aid
alone cannot resolve the deeper issues affecting

However, former Australian cricketer Tom
Moody has pointed out that Test cricket still has a
place in the modern game, provided the
challenges posed by the rise of franchise leagues
and changing audience preferences are
effectively addressed.20
Uncertainty Surrounding Broadcaster’s Rights

against England. The PCB's initial reserve price of
around USD 11.2 million deterred potential
broadcasters. It finally settled for a final deal at
USD 6-6.5 million, much lower than their initial
expectations.21 Similarly, in January 2025,

played. Originally developed to incentivise
consistent performance, disparities in the
number of fixtures unfairly penalised teams with
heavier schedules. England, for instance, played
twice as many matches as South Africa, which
increased their exposure to potential point
losses.
Consequently,
despite
some
commendable performances, they failed to
secure a spot in the final.

This underscores a broader trend where Test
matches struggle to attract lucrative broadcast
deals, and only certain fixtures driven by intense
country rivalries draw massive audiences. The
falling market interest and economic viability of
broadcasting Test cricket represent serious
challenges to the format's future.

The disparity extends across the table, with
Australia playing 16 and India 18, while teams like
Sri Lanka and Bangladesh, with fewer fixtures,
benefit from reduced scheduling pressure and
remain competitive. Former England captain
Kevin Pietersen and other critics argue that this
imbalance raises concerns regarding the fairness
of the final standings.24

Structural and Scheduling Issues
Discussions Regarding a Potential Two-tier
System

Structural Issues in the Current Format

With the advent of short-format cricket and
overseas T20 leagues, Test cricket has taken a
backseat in a way. Thus, in a bid to revive the
oldest cricket format, the ICC has reportedly
made proposals to introduce a two-tier system
for the WTC.

Test cricket faces several structural challenges
which have a significant impact on its fairness
and parity, which include unequal scheduling of
matches and the WTC points system. The current
WTC cycle does not ensure that all teams play
against each other, leading to an imbalance in
rankings. For instance, the absence of IndiaPakistan fixtures due to political tensions
weakens the credibility of the championship.23

In such a structure, the team or teams finishing at
the bottom of the top division at the end of a WTC
cycle would be relegated to the second tier.
Meanwhile, the team or teams topping the
second division would earn promotion to the top

competitive structure in Test cricket.

league matches, which have a significant physical
and mental strain. Players are required to switch
frequently between formats without taking
requisite breaks, thereby increasing the risk of
strain and burnout.

As per reports, India, Australia, England, South
Africa, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and New Zealand
could be part of tier one, while West Indies,
Bangladesh,
Afghanistan,
Ireland, and
Zimbabwe will be put in the second tier.25

As a result, players are compelled to prioritize
certain formats, forcing teams to rest key players
and field weakened squads. Young cricketers are
also increasingly confined to just one or two
formats, restricting their growth and
opportunities for advancement. 28

In that scenario, marquee series could take place
on a more frequent basis with two Ashes contests
every three years as opposed to the current two in
four.26

Players being overworked is a critical concern,
particularly in Test cricket due to the demanding
nature of the format. Several players have
reported burnout and overwork due to the taxing
schedule, notable examples of whom are Ben
Stokes, Glenn Maxwell and Yuvraj Singh.

However, this raises significant concerns for tiertwo teams. Without playing higher-ranked
teams, there is a chance the Full Members in the
bottom tier would struggle to improve, and
players may be increasingly drawn to franchise
leagues. Without top-tier teams playing the
lower-ranked sides, it poses a danger to those
boards, as they may suffer financially due to
reduced TV earnings. 27

Player rotation, sufficient rest, identifying
specialists for each format, and nurturing a
strong second and third tier of players who can
step in when needed have become key priorities
for National Boards and team managements.29

and

Inadequate

Given the strict eligibility criteria, and the
inherent constraints which the associate
members have, they face very limited
opportunities to play Test cricket matches at all,
and instead focus on and invest in limited-overs
formats of cricket instead.

Limitations for Associate Members
Associate Members are the governing body for
cricket of a country recognised by the ICC,
countries associated for cricket purposes, or a
geographical area, which does not qualify as a
Full Member but where cricket is firmly
established and organised.30 In International Test
Cricket, only Full Members of the ICC are eligible
to play Test matches. For an Associate Member to
gain Full Member status, they must meet several
criteria, such as consistent performance, a wellestablished domestic cricket structure,
adherence to financial and governance
standards, and the organization of development
programs.31

Their perseverance is reflected in ICC
tournaments, where teams like the Netherlands
and Scotland have demonstrated their ability to
compete with established cricketing nations
when given the necessary support.
Insufficient Support for Women's Test Cricket
Greg Barclay, the former chair of the
International Cricket Council, cautioned fans to
expect a decline in the number of Test matches in
the coming years and said women’s Tests will not
be part of the landscape moving forward to any
real extent.

Associate members often struggle financially to
accommodate Test cricket, in particular with
player salaries and infrastructure.32 Hosting a
Test series can be financially draining, making it
challenging for smaller nations to invest in this
format. Moreover, these nations are concerned
that the proposed revenue distribution model,
which largely favours cricket’s dominant boards,
could impede the sport’s growth and
sustainability.

A total of 143 women’s Tests have been played in
the format’s 88-year history but only five since
2015, and only once since 2007 has a team other
than England, India and Australia competed in
one. With the sport’s focus increasingly trained
on shorter formats, Barclay does not expect a
scheduling surge.33 This decline in women's Test
cricket raises concerns about its long-term
viability, emphasizing the need for greater
commitment from governing bodies to preserve
and promote the format.

Furthermore, women in cricket experience
marginalization and misogyny, with the women's
game often treated as subordinate to the men's
game. The England Women’s team has yet to
play a Test Match at Lord’s, with their first
opportunity scheduled for 202634—a milestone,
yet one that highlights the prolonged wait for
such recognition.

Ball tests. Admittedly, Australia being one of the
only nations adapting to it, Pink-Ball tests have
been under speculation over the course of its
introduction, dating back to the early 2000s.
The said idea was engendered after an analysis of
the trends as seen in White-Ball cricket. The T-20
and One Day International (ODI) Formats
boasted a hefty viewership and peaked its
engagement during primetime, which was postsundown. An idea was evinced amongst the
media and myriads of cricket enthusiasts, to
witness Test cricket under the lights. This very
idea urged ICC to undertake actions to fulfil the
demands that modern-day cricket called for.

Additionally, the pay disparity between male and
female cricketers has long been a concern, with
top women players earning significantly less than
their male counterparts. A report highlighted the
need for a fundamental overhaul of the
professional women players’ pay structure and
equal representation in cricket's governance
structures.35

Challenges

However, a positive development came in 2022
when the BCCI announced equal match fees for
India’s men’s and women’s teams, ensuring
parity in per-match earnings across formats.36
Despite this progress, several challenges remain,
including disparities in central contracts, prize
money, and overall investment in women's
cricket.

The introduction to Pink-Ball Tests led to major
progressive problems, involving constructive
criticism from fans and technical roadblocks
which delve deep into the mechanism of cricket.
The given ball, for a Test cricket match, involves a
red ball made of high-quality leather, for it to
sustain the wear and tear it would endure for the
course of the 90 overs. Furthermore, it is red in
colour to improve its visibility for Test matches,
unlike the usual white ball we see in other forms
of cricket, which is discreetly used for better
visibility under floodlights.37

Subsequently, ideas for this included an
enhanced version of the white ball to last the

the coloured kits. However, this proposition was

whole.

keep the sport a rather more enjoyable
experience by making it more memorable.
On the contrary, an archetypal example could
include the Border-Gavaskar Trophy, which
spoke volumes for the fact that the originality
and individuality of test cricket, in a fresher PinkBall format could be marketed in a much more
effective way.38

Moreover, the overarching framework which was
being constituted, faced numerous rebuttals
from active players then. Upon this rejection of
idea, subsequently the board was compelled to
dismiss such ideas after refusal from players to
partake in such competitions.

Pink-Ball tests are till date often recognised to be
rather favourable to the Australian contingent,
who have adopted and embraced this concept
entirely. Subsequently this poses a huge reason
for lack of participation from other nations in
Pink-Ball match-ups as it sets up a premise for
claims suggesting these fixtures to be “unfair”.39

Breakthroughs
Over the course of the past decade, the global
stance with respect to Pink-Ball test cricket has
had drastic changes, which was a consequent
response to the contrasting and effective analysis
of the game pragmatically.

Neglect of Women in Test Cricket

In essence, the first major breakthrough in PinkBall tests was soon marked, when a Pink-Ball Test
was played in Adelaide post sundown, wherein
Australia emerged victorious over New Zealand,
in November 2015.

Background
Over the past decade, there has been consistent
and considerable growth in the popularity of
Women’s cricket, especially in limited over
formats. Upon this surge in viewership, the
deteriorating state of the fan-following for Test
cricket as a whole has etched Women’s sport in its
entirety in terms of Test Cricket.

Additionally, Australia upon embracing the novel
idea of adapting the idea of “Pink Ball Cricket”,
have witnessed conservatively very quantifiable
viewership records.
Ever since, the other nations have gradually
accepted the concept of Pink-Ball tests after a fair
share of active discussions amongst the
governing bodies of their respective nations.

The idea of Women’s test cricket was
conservatively quoted to be one of the pillars for
preserving the very sanctity of the sport, with
respect to the sport and its quality, as suggested
by the Women’s Cricket Association of India
(WCAI).

Contrasting Beliefs
Resonating with the beliefs of myriads, the
concept of a test match being played in the night
often was recognised as an experiment much
closer to be an ostentatious fad, a gimmicky
concept indeed to engage the viewers and to

forms. Moreover, 5 years before this merger,
there was a survey conducted by the IWCC. The
results of the survey incited the call for all nations
urging for a fair combination of Test cricket and
One Day cricket.40

Reforms
In order to cater to the diminishing demands of
Women’s test cricket, ICC along with England &
Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and Cricket Australia
have allied to bring reforms to the infrastructure
of domestic cricket, in order to lay an
omnipresent foundation globally to reinforce the
strength and legacy of Test cricket.43

Challenges
The enthusiasm of the players kept uplifting the
spirits of the sport. The players were always found
to be under the crosshairs for media scrutiny,
especially with only one game a year being
played, affecting their morality in terms of the
sport’s climate socially.41

A fresh reiteration to the pre-existing format to
the play of cricket involved an improved
frequency of scheduling such games. Scheduling
abundant breaks between different formats of
play, including T20 and ODI formats, adhering to
the workload management of players allows for
the sport to be rather more enjoyable while
portraying different formats being played
improving the quality of gameplay for Women’s
cricket amicably resolved numerous nuances.

Another factor which continues to be a pressing
matter in terms of gender imbalance in sport
globally, both domestically and internationally,
is inadequate funding towards the Women’s
faction. This unevenness in funding consequently
leads to lesser opportunities for Women’s cricket.

Another integral aspect of Test cricket, Ashes,
illustrates the legacy and rivalry between the 2
teams, speaks volumes for the build-up and story
behind the two teams set standards for Test
cricket between the 2 teams, making it an ideal
storyline to entice the viewers. Consequently,
Women’s Ashes was introduced in order to
elevate the standards of Test Cricket and not limit
it just to the male aspect.44

This in turn reflects upon the added limitations to
the given ambit of Women’s sports in general.
This reiterates the unfair and limited media
coverage being scarcely granted to Women’s Test
cricket, or women’s sports generally. A relatively
lower media coverage further caps the ambit of
women’s Test cricket in this economy, deterring
their chances at sponsorships or mere media
engagement.42

Women’s Test cricket successful, the introduction

have been one of the factors for the Australian
team’s defeat to India by 295 runs in Perth.
Ricky Ponting expressed his frustration over the
scheduling conflict. He stated that it was the
worst possible case scenario for him and Justin
Langer. He mentioned that leading to the
auction, they had anticipated that it would be
scheduled in the gap between the Test matches.
He further said that if the overlap had been
avoided, the added pressure would have been
taken off the players from both teams, as many of
them were in the auction pool.47

Scheduling Clash: IPL Auction vs. BorderGavaskar Trophy
Background
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI)
was criticised for scheduling the Indian Premier
League (IPL) 2025 Mega Auction during the
opening Test match of the Border-Gavaskar
Trophy (BGT) between India and Australia.46 The
scheduling conflict meant that several key
Australian cricket personalities, including Ricky
Ponting, had to split their commitments between
the two events.

The major criticism was that the timing was
puzzling, as there was enough break between the
1st and 2nd tests to accommodate the auction
without any clash. Ponting also speculated about
why the dates had been chosen, suggesting that
it might have been related to the game. It was
suggested that the auction was started on air
almost immediately after the end of play, so it
might have been related to the broadcast and
boosting viewership, which attracted 22.8 million
viewers, marking a 29% increase compared to the
previous year.48

Challenges
The Indian Premier League auction, scheduled
for 24 and 25 November 2024 in Jeddah, Saudi
Arabia, saw Ponting (head coach of Punjab
Kings), Langer (coach of Lucknow Super Giants),
and Vettori (coach of Sunrisers Hyderabad)
absent from significant portions of the Perth
Test. Ponting and Langer were available only for
the opening day of commentary with Channel
Seven before flying out for the auction. It is
believed that the absence of key coaches could

successful it required that all their top players be
contracted to play in the T20 competition.

The CSA cancelled a tour of Australia scheduled
early last year to ensure the presence of their top
players in the inaugural edition of the SA20,
which is bankrolled by the Indian Premier League
franchises. Australia captain Pat Cummins hoped
South Africa's decision did not signal a drift away
from test cricket.

CSA had stated their case to the ICC, but the Test
series remained on the schedule and the Proteas
sent an under-strength squad to New Zealand.
The Proteas were subsequently soundly beaten in
the series, while many criticized SA for sending
the inexperienced team over for the Test series.

Pakistan captain Shan Masood said the situation
could have been avoided by better scheduling.
The batter said that all the best sides had to play
for the World Test Championship, so it was a pity
that a full-strength squad was not being sent by
South Africa. He expressed hope that,
somewhere down the line, schedules could be
made in a certain way where the strongest
elevens were seen playing Test cricket.

Challenges
Former Australia captain Steve Waugh said
South Africa's decision to send a shadow side to
New Zealand for a test tour while their top
players take part in a domestic T20 tournament
shows the longest format of the game is under
threat.49

Star South African pacer Kagiso Rabada stated

Cricket South Africa (CSA) named seven

considered important for the success of the

Waugh said the governing International Cricket
Council (ICC) and other administrators should
step in to protect test cricket. He told the Sydney
Morning Herald newspaper that it was obvious
they did not care. He stated that if he were New
Zealand, the series would not even be played. He
questioned why it was even being played when
New Zealand cricket was being shown a lack of
respect. He further said that if the ICC or someone
did not step in shortly, then Test cricket would not
remain Test cricket because the best players were
not being tested against.

The scheduling conflict between SA20 and Test
cricket posed various challenges, impacting
player availability and team performance.
However, in January 2025, the third edition of the
tournament commenced without overlapping
with Test matches, marking a significant step
toward better coordination.51

While Test cricket remains the foundation of the
sport, it has faced numerous challenges with the
rise of shorter formats, leading to shifting
audience preferences and a decline in
mainstream appeal.
However, it continues to be respected for its
strategic depth, rich history, unwavering
competitive spirit and the unique test of skill and
endurance it offers to players. Significant
measures are needed in order to ensure that the
legacy of Test cricket is upheld and strengthened.
